# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The script run_analysis.R can be run to output the clean data as samsung_data.txt

It loads the data, merges it, extracts the means and standard deviations, adds labels, then generates means for all columns

The input data should be placed in a directory called "dataset", which includes the "train" and "test" folders, as well as the features.txt, features_info.txt, and activity_labels.txt files
